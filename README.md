This program toggles low level hardware signals using undocumented ROM functions.
It is intended for developer use.  You should know what you're doing, as this
could do damage to your hardware.

Limitations
-----------

I have tried to include support for the German variant of the MessagePad 2x00,
however, I do not have one to test against.  It is possible that I could have
made typos or errors in the code that would prevent it from working properly on
a German version.  Proceed at your own risk.

Purpose
-------

The Newton MessagePad 2x00 has an internal slot that was intended for an 
internal modem accessory that was never made.  The connector exposes several
capabilities, including three serial channels, power, audio, and a GPIO pin.

For more information on the internal serial slot, you can see some content
I posted to blogspot at the following address.

Eckhart KÃ¶ppen, author of Blunt (the bluetooth stack for the Newton), as 
posted some sorce code for toggling the SerialPortSelect signal for Serial 
Channel 3. 

This code serves as an excellent primer for calling arbirary functions in ROM.

At its heart, this app would not be possible were it not for Eckhart's template
to follow.

Eckhart calls the WriteDIOPins function to directly toggle the pin at 0x22 for
SerialPortSel3.  Instead, I have called SerialPort3LineDriverConfig to perform
this same function.  In the end, its about the same.

There is also a SerialPort0LineDriverConfig function for toggling the 
SerPortSel0 signal.  This application also directly calls the GPIO functions
for accessing pin 26 (the General Purpose I/O pin)
